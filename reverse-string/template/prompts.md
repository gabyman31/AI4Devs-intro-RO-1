Act as a Javascript Web UI Developer. Create a JS code script to generate a web Page.
The main function is  to reverse the order of the string  provided in the text field, in the web page.
For instance: for the word AI4Devs, the page retrieves sveD4AI.
Conditions:
If the string has three characters or more than three characters the text should be prompted already reversed in BOLD font.
A reverse button is visible and enabled only if the word has 3 characters or more than three.
In case the word contains less than 3 characters, the message should be prompted saying that "The word should be longer than 3 characters
The page should provide the reversed word or the error message, in real time. it means there is no necessary any other event after the string has been provided.
a Clean button should be available below the text field to clean the text field and the response in the web page.
Separate the implementation in two files. An index.html and script.js
